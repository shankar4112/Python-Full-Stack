Approach:
Extract Key Skills from Job Description – Use NLP techniques to identify important skills and keywords.
Parse and Extract Resume Data – Convert resumes (PDF, DOCX) into structured text using libraries like PyMuPDF, pdfminer, or docx.
Compare Resumes with Job Description – Use text similarity techniques like TF-IDF, BERT embeddings, or spaCy to match skills.
Rank and Filter Resumes – Score resumes based on the number of matching keywords and return the most relevant ones.
Python Implementation:
Would you like a basic Python script for this? I can provide a script that:
✅ Reads job descriptions and resumes
✅ Extracts key skills using NLP
✅ Matches resumes with job descriptions using similarity scoring
✅ Returns shortlisted resumes
